Introduction \nVariation in social, health and economic outcomes by adult height is studied in the \nhumanities, medicine, public health and the social sciences. This research has reported that taller \npeople have advantages ranging from higher wages and educational achievement through higher \noverall life satisfaction, but face higher probabilities of certain morbidities (e.g., Deaton and \nArora 2009).   The focus of economic research on this topic is how variation in cognitive and \nnon cognitive skills with height can explain corresponding variation in wages.  These skills are \nviewed as markers, or the result, of the underlying determinants of a reward to height: 1) the \nsocial license or dominance that taller people enjoy which enhances the development of these \nskills, or 2) the different endowments of taller people which interact with the environment to \nsimilar effect.  Of course, another explanation is discrimination, but given evidence that \nmeasures of social and cognitive skills can account for correlations of wages with height, it has \nreceived less attention. \nThe importance of, and possible policy responses to, this variation in outcomes by height \ndepend on its source, its incidence and its magnitude.  Currently the within population cause of \nthe variation in many outcomes remains unclear.1  For example, in the economics literature Case \nPaxson (2008) argue that the important underlying variation is in cognitive abilities with height, \ndue to variation in an endowment which determines both.2  In contrast, Persico et al. (2004) \nargue that the important variation is in teenage social activities with height, which in turn helps \nbuild non cognitive skills which are rewarded in the labor market.  Subsequent studies \n                                                \n1 Here a distinction is made from across populations variation, or the variation in height within populations over \ntime, for which nutrition and disease appear to play a dominant role (e.g., Grasgruber et al. 2014). \n2 The endowment is hypothesized to be determined by genetic factors, prenatal/early childhood environment or the \ninteraction of the two. \n \n \n \n \n3 \n(Lundborg et al. 2014 and Schick and Steckel 2015) using direct measures of cognitive and non \ncognitive ability find a role for both. \nWhich heights matter can vary by context and assumption.  For example, a medical of \ndefinition of short (or tall) stature, identifying those individuals with a condition that may require \nongoing observation or treatment, is height more than two standard deviations from the mean, \nwhich captures roughly 2 percent of the population.  Evidence that US presidents are typically \ntaller than the mean adult male height in the US population, which is presented, for example, in \nPersico et al. (2004) and widely available on the internet, promotes a popular understanding that \nbeing tall (above average height) matters.  In practice, a linear height profile is assumed in many \nempirical studies which assumes that height matters across the distribution.3 \nIn economics, studies provide a range of estimates of how much height matters.  For \nexample, for hourly earnings estimates range from one to more than two and half percent per \ninch, which implies that over the interquartile range of male height (4 inches) wages differ by 4 \nto in excess of 10 percent. \nFinally, the possible public policy responses to this variation depend on which cause is \ndominant.  Persico et al. (2004) argue there are economically significant benefits from human \ngrowth hormone treatment, to increase teenage height, for a sizable fraction of the population.  \nCase and Paxson (2008) counsel further research into how prenatal and childhood nutrition affect \nadult outcomes and cognitive function. \n                                                \n3 This is as much a result of the small sample sizes available in surveys that offer both height and socio economic \noutcomes.  There are some important exceptions discussed below. \n \n \n \n \n4 \nIn this paper we undertake a detailed examination of how human capital investments and \na wide set of socio-economic outcomes vary by height to shed new light on the magnitude, \nincidence and origins of the height gradient.  Our study offers three significant findings. \nFirst, we present evidence that height profile in completed education and other important \nsocioeconomic outcomes is significantly non linear at mean height for both males and females.  \nThis finding is to our knowledge new, and implies that the variation in these outcomes by height \nis a) confined to specific parts of the height distribution, and b) as a result, experienced more \nacutely by affected individuals than might be inferred from previous research.  \nThe top panel of Figure 1 is representative of the inference.  Here we graph the estimates \nof single inch height dummy variables from a regression of years of completed years of \neducation for males on height, age (single year), region and race/ethnicity using the 1990-94 \nNational Health Interview Survey (NHIS, described in more detail below).  The omitted height \ncategory is 70\u201d, which is mean, median and modal height in the sample.  At least three features \nof this graph stand out.  First, there is little statistically or economically significant variation in \ncompleted education at heights above the mean.   Second, in contrast, the variation below mean \nheight is both statistically and economically significant.  At one inch below the mean it is almost \none half a year, and at the 10th percentile of height (66\u201d) it is over one year. Third, there is a \nremarkable asymmetry directly around mean height\u2014the difference in completed education is \nmuch greater one inch below the mean than one inch above.  The estimates for females (bottom \npanel, figure 1) also display significant variation below mean height, and asymmetry around \nmean height, but the variation above mean height is also significant above 68 inches, which is \nthe 90th percentile of the distribution.  \n \n \n \n \n5 \nSecond, these non linear height profiles provide additional leverage to identify the \nunderlying correlates of the variation of outcomes with height.  As illustration, we revisit \nresearch that investigates how direct measures of cognitive and non cognitive skills attenuate the \ncorrelation between height and wages.    For males, measures of cognitive skills from the teenage \nyears and late childhood display the same non linearity in height as adult outcomes.  Specifying a \nnon linear height profile in wages reveals that these cognitive skills account for substantively \nmore of the variation of wages with height than non cognitive skills.  For females more \nsymmetric contributions of the cognitive and non cognitive skills remain, consistent with \nprevious research. \nThird, measures of family background (parental education) and birth outcomes \n(birthweight) provide separate, independent accounts of non trivial proportions of the variation \nof childhood cognitive scores with height that is common (by specification) across the height \ndistribution, but have limited power to account for the more substantive variation below mean \nheight.  Extending this analysis, we find that the account of parental height both spans, and is \ngreater than, the account of parental education, but again has limited traction for the variation in \nscores below the average.  As a result, markers of this important variation in outcomes below the \nmean, especially for males, are elusive and are an important topic for future research. \nIn the next section we review previous studies that offer evidence of non linearities in \nheight profiles. Section 3 provides a description of the data and our empirical framework.  In \nsection 4 we document the pervasiveness of the non linear height profile in socio economic \noutcomes.  We also demonstrate how the variation below mean height compares to variation by \nrace/ethnicity.  In Section 5 we investigate how measures of cognitive and non cognitive skills \ncan account for variation of wages with height.  Section 6 contains an analysis of how the adult \n \n \n \n \n6 \nheight profile in childhood cognitive scores is associated with family background variables, birth \noutcomes and parental height.   Section 7 contains discussion and conclusions. \n2. Previous Evidence of Non Linear Height Profiles \n \nMany previous studies adopt a linear specification of the height profile because most \nsurveys with both height and socioeconomic outcomes have small sample sizes.  The first of our \ncontributions to the literature is enabled by the large sample sizes of the NHIS, which allows us \nto examine variation by height at a more granular level.   \nWhere non linear profiles have been specified in past research they are necessarily of a \nfairly parametric form.  Heineck (2009) provides evidence of a quadratic relationship between \nwages and height in the British Household Panel Survey.  Less parametric specifications (e.g., \nquintile dummy variables) are suggestive but the estimates are mostly statistically insignificant.  \nSchick and Steckel (2015) also present evidence of a non linear height profile for male earnings \nusing data from the British National Child Development Survey (NCDS).  They identify the \nflattening in the male height profile at 72\u201d of height from a specification that divides males\u2019 \nheights into 5 intervals. Hubler (2009) investigates polynomial and spline specifications of the \nheight profile of German wages.  He concludes that the height effect is largest for relatively tall \nmen (75\u201d).4   \nClosest to the evidence we present is Kim and Han (2017) who show that the unadjusted \nrelationship between height and monthly wages of Korean males plateaus at the mean height in \ntheir sample (figure 1). This finding is of particular interest here because the average height of \nKorean males at 67\u201d, is considerably less than in the samples of Americans we analyze.  They \nparameterize the height profile in 5 centimetre (roughly 2 inch) intervals and conclude that \n                                                \n4 Sohn (2015) makes a similar finding for Indonesian males using a polynomial specification. \n \n \n \n \n7 \nconditioning on a variety of demographic and economic characteristics the estimates for males \ncorroborate the inference from the unadjusted data.5   \n3. Data and Empirical Framework \nTo examine various socioeconomic outcomes by height we use data from the NHIS.  This \nis a national, representative survey of the American population with a primary focus on health \noutcomes.  For our purposes it captures self reported height; highest level of education; \nrace/ethnicity; in some years, 3-digit occupation; self reported health; and the poverty status of \nthe household.  Much of our evidence is based on the 1990-1994 NHIS.  These are survey years \nthat offer detailed occupational coding and match well with the 1991 edition of the Dictionary of \nOccupational Titles and 1990 census, which we use in some of the occupational analysis.  It is \nalso a period in which the response rate to the NHIS averaged near 95 percent (Lucas et al. 2006, \nMoriarity and Dahlhamer 2012). We also obtain evidence from other years of this survey; for \nexample, the 2010-2013 surveys to examine stability in the height profiles over time.  However, \nit is important to note that response rates in the NHIS have fallen over time, dropping by more \nthan 10 percentage points between the mid 1990s and 2010 (Czajka and Beyler 2016).  Except \nwhere noted, we select samples of adults aged 25-59 to be more certain that formal human \ncapital investments are complete and adult height has been obtained, and to avoid sample \nselection problems in some of the outcomes due to retirement. \nThe NHIS surveys record self reported height.  Doctor or interviewer recorded height \nwould be preferable because validation studies have revealed error in the self reports of this \nvariable.  As explained below we also examine data from the National Health and Nutrition \n                                                \n5 The non parameteric estimates of the wage/height profile for males in figure 2 of Case and Paxson (2008) also \nanticipate our inference, but are not pursued in that study.  Also see figure 4 of Lundborg et al. (2014), but also \nfigure 1. \n \n \n \n \n8 \nExamination Survey (NHANES) to discover if the self report of heights in the NHIS is \nmaterially affecting our results. \nWe also use data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to \ninvestigate the contributions of cognitive and non cognitive skills to the non linear profiles of \neconomic outcomes in stature. The NLSY79 first surveyed a sample of 14-21 year olds in 1979, \nwith follow-ups annually until 1994 and every two years thereafter. Each wave asks questions \nabout completed education and earnings. Because there is sample attrition over time, we use a \nrelatively early wave \u2013 1990 \u2013 for our analysis. This is the earliest year in which all respondents \nare at least 25 years of age, which helps ensure that we are measuring completed education. To \nmaximize sample size, we follow Lang and Manove (2011) and use a 3 year average of earnings \nfrom 1989, 1990 and 1991 to calculate wages. This procedure allows us to include individuals \nwho do not report earnings in 1990. Self-reported height is available in the 1981, 1982 and 1985 \nwaves, and every survey year from 2006-2014. We use the 1985 wave because it is the time \nperiod closest to the time when our earnings and education variables are measured. The NLSY79 \nalso contains each respondent\u2019s Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score (recorded in \n1981), as well as a wide variety of personality and attitudinal measures.  \nWe use the US public use Natality Files to examine the relationship between poor birth \noutcomes and mother\u2019s height.  Starting with the 2003 revision, US birth certificate data records \nmother\u2019s height.  We use the data from 2011, the first year the height variable appears in the \ncodebook, and also a year that is both proximate to the time of our other surveys and has the \ninformation on mother\u2019s height for the majority of births.6 \n                                                \n6 The height variable first appears in the NBER sourced public use birth certificate data in 2009, but does not appear \nin the codebook.  We use the 2011 data as this is the first year the variable is officially recorded in the codebook, \nand the rate of non response/missing data is smaller than in the previous years.  In 2011, data on mother\u2019s height is \n \n \n \n \n9 \nFinally, we use the British National Child Development Survey (NCDS).  The NCDS has \nbeen a workhorse of research on the returns to height. It has followed almost an entire cohort of \nchildren born in a particular week in 1958 from birth to adulthood.  While its sample sizes are \nquite small, and it is for a different country, the NCDS offers cognitive testing at much younger \nages than the NLSY79 and direct observations on both adult height and some birth outcomes.  \nOur parametrization of the height profile, where sample sizes allow, is at the same level \nof detail as the responses in the surveys.  Specifically, we regress, by sex, various outcomes on \nsingle inch height dummy variables and a minimal set of controls.  \n(1)     \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc37# = \ud835\udefc+ \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udefe+ \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udefd+ \ud835\udf00# \nwhere, for example, EDi is a measure of completed education, H is a vector of (single inch) \nheight dummy variables (the dummy for mean height is excluded), and X includes age (single \nyear), region, race/ethnicity (African American, Hispanic, \u201cother\u201d), foreign birth and indicators \nfor survey year (where necessary).    \n \nFor the analyses of surveys with smaller samples, and also as a means of summary, we \nalso estimate a regression with a linear specification of the height profile allowing a slope break \nat heights below the mean.   \n(2)     \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc37# = \ud835\udf03+ \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc3b# + \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3b# + \ud835\udf11\ud835\udc3b# \u22c5\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3b# + \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udf0f+ \ud835\udf14# \nwhere SHi is a dummy variable for individuals with heights below mean height. For this \nspecification we rescale the height variable to have zero mean to facilitate the interpretation of \nthe SH dummy variable as capturing any discontinuity in the height profile at mean height.   \n                                                \nnot available for Alabama, Alaska, Arizona Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \nMississippi, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia.  Non response is relatively high in Washington \nDC (11.5%) and Georgia (17.9%).  Height is observable for just under 84% of births in our selected sample (see \nbelow). \n \n \n \n \n10 \n4. The Height Profile in Education, Occupational Choice, Poverty and Self Reported \nHealth \n \nIn table 1 we report summary statistics, by sex, for the self reported heights reported in \nthe NHIS data. Average height is 70\u201d for males and 64\u201d for females.  For males, the interquartile \nand 90/10 percentile ranges are +/- 2 and 4 inches from the mean.   For females there is a similar \nprogression above mean height, but the 25th and 10th percentiles are one and three inches below \nmean height, respectively.  \nIn figure 1 we graph the height profile (estimates of ), with 95 percent confidence \nintervals,7 for years of completed education in the 1990-94 NHIS.    We specify a full set of \nheight dummy variables in the estimation, but report estimates for the height ranges 63\u201d though \n76\u201d for males and 59\u201d though 70\u201d for females in the figures.8     In both cases this omits about 4 \npercent of the distribution of heights. Note that the markers for 70\u201d (males) and 64\u201d (females) are \nlocated at 0 and have no confidence interval indicating the omitted category. \nThe results for males in the first panel display the aforementioned non linearity at mean \nheight.  Hispanics are shorter on average than many other groups in the US population and also \nhave lower average educational attainment.  We allow the height profiles to vary by an intercept \nshift for ethnicity, but it is possible that our estimates simply capture the unequal distribution of \nthe different ethnic groups across the height profile.  To see if this is true we also report the \nheight profile omitting blacks and Hispanics from the sample. The results, also reported in figure \n                                                \n7 We estimate robust standard errors. \n8 While the 1990-94 NHIS include all heights reported, the 2010-13 NHIS only reports height between 63\u201d and 76\u201d \nfor males and 59\u201d and 70\u201d for females.  Furthermore other heights are not observed if the individual reported a \nweight that was outside bottom coding and top coding for this variable. Adding controls for weight (single pound) \ndoes not substantively change the height profiles of completed education. \n\u03b3\n \n \n \n \n11 \n1, show that while the educational deficits at shorter heights are smaller making this omission, \nsubstantial and significant non linearity at mean height remains.  \nThere are also cohort effects in height so the variation in education by height in figure 1 \nmight simply reflect the fact that older cohorts are shorter and have less education on average.  In \nfact, the variation in average height by age across our 25 to 59 year old sample is only 0.59 \ninches, and estimates of separate height profiles (not reported) for the 25-40 and 41-59 age \nintervals display similar patterns, as do the height profiles from the 2010-13 NHIS (appendix A).   \nAnother possible confounding factor is weight.  However, the height profile estimated \nconditional on single pound weight dummy variables (not reported) is again very similar to the \none reported in figure 1.  \nBecause it is not obvious how differences in completed years of education map into \ndegrees and diplomas we have also estimated these profiles for significant milestones of \neducational attainment (not reported).9  Each displays similar non linearity and, for example, \nindicates that at a height just one inch below the mean, the \u201cno high school diploma\u201d rate is \nalmost one-third higher than at average height, which was 11 percent, or 10 percent for non-\nHispanic whites, in 1990-94 (see also figure B2 in appendix B).  By two inches below mean \nheight, attainment of a 4 year college degree or higher is in excess of 18 percent lower than at \nmean height, while at two inches above mean height the rate it is roughly the same.   \nIn the second panel of figure 1 is the profile for females. Here we observe many of the \neducational differences by height are smaller than for males, but there is still significant variation \n                                                \n9 These results are available on request.  The profiles for not completing a high school diploma from the 2010-13 \nNHIS are reported in appendix B. \n \n \n \n \n12 \nbelow, and asymmetry around, mean height.10  What is new here is the variation in completed \neducation in the upper 10 percent heights.  Excluding blacks and Hispanics from the sample \nagain makes little difference to this inference.  In profiles not shown, the estimates for no high \nschool diploma at heights 61\u201d through 63\u201d are more than twice the estimates, in absolute value, \nat heights 65\u201d through 67\u201d.  At 3 inches below mean height college attainment is lower by almost \n5 percentage points or 22 percent, while at 3 inches above the mean it is just over 1 percentage \npoint higher. \nAs noted, the NHIS height variable is self reported.  In appendix B we briefly summarize \nsome previous studies of error in self reported height.  We also compare the height profiles for \nthe no high school diploma outcome11 from the NHIS and NHANES, and within the NHANES \nby self reported height and examination recorded height.  As noted there we observe that the non \nlinearities documented in the NHIS data are also present in both the self reported and exam \nrecorded height profiles in the NHANES.  While there is no doubt some error in the self report of \nheight it does not appear to affect our inference of substantial non linearities in the height \nprofiles of educational attainment at mean height.12  \nIn addition to educational investment, occupational choice appears to be a primary \nintermediary between cognitive or non cognitive skills and labor market outcomes.   Case et al. \n(2009) demonstrate that in a wage regression the estimated coefficient on height is significantly \nattenuated when additional controls for educational attainment and occupational fixed effects are \nadded as control variables.  \n                                                \n10 For females, conditioning on weight the differences by height are marginally larger and the profile retains the \nsame shape as in figure 1. \n11 Years of completed education are not available in the public use NHANES. \n12 Persico et al. (2004) come to a similar conclusion for their inference comparing self reported and exam recorded \nheights in the NCDS. \n \n \n \n \n13 \nTo reduce the dimensionality of occupational choice, we first rank occupations by their \naverage earnings.  The 1990-94 NHIS provides information on respondents\u2019 detailed (3 digit) \noccupation.13  We calculate average annual earnings at this occupational level by sex, using a \nsimilarly selected sample from the 1990 US census.  We next assign these averages to NHIS \nrespondents based on their reported occupations.  We then estimate equation (1) using the log of \nthese averages as the dependent variable.   \nThe results are reported in figure 2.14  For males we observe a sharply non linear profile.  \nThere is effectively no advantage in this component of earnings for individuals with heights \nabove the mean.  For heights below the mean the deficit is substantial\u2014an earnings deficit of 10 \npercent or more for the bottom 20 percent of heights.  For females the orders of magnitude are \nsmaller, but the profile exhibits the greater variation below mean height, the asymmetry around \nthe mean, and the variation in the upper 10 percent of heights see in figure 1.  Visually roughly \nhalf of the earnings deficits below mean height for males can be accounted for by the \ncorresponding non linearities in the educational investments.15    For females, education accounts \nfor part of the variation below the mean height, and most of the variation in the upper ten \npercentiles.   \nAs a second approach we rank occupations by their skill level. To do this we merge \nDictionary of Occupational Title (DOT) data (1991 edition) to our 1990-94 sample.  We next \nconstruct the different routine and non routine task constructs as proposed by Autor et al. (2003).  \nWe then standardize each task to have 0 mean and unit standard deviation and then assign the \n                                                \n13 The 1990-1994 NHIS contains a detailed occupation variable with coding that corresponds to the 1990 Census \noccupational classification.  \n14 Excluding blacks and Hispanics from the sample does not substantially change the inference (estimates not \nshown).  We cluster the standard errors by occupation. \n15 The control is years of completed education.   \n \n \n \n \n14 \ntask content of NHIS respondents\u2019 employment based on their reported 3-digit occupation.  \nThese estimates of occupational task content then serve as a dependent variable in (1).16   \nBy these definitions, Autor and Price (2013) show that non routine analytical and \ninterpersonal skills are in the ascendency in the American labor market over the past four to five \ndecades, while manual and routine cognitive skills are in the decline.  In figure 3 we report the \nresults for Non Routine Interpersonal and Routine Cognitive, the skills that saw the largest \nincrease or decline over the period 1960 through 2010.  For males there is significant non linear \nvariation around mean height\u2014effectively no variation for the majority of males of mean height \nor taller, but at a height of two inches below the mean (the 25th percentile) the content of Non \nRoutine Interpersonal skill is 10 percent of a standard deviation lower and the content of Routine \nCognitive skill just over 5 percent of a standard deviation higher, than at mean height.  The \nestimates for those in the bottom quartile of height are substantially larger with the deficit in Non \nRoutine Interpersonal skills ranging from over 20 percent to over 40 percent of a standard \ndeviation. For females the differences are smaller than for males.  The estimated height profile \nshows the same features as for the previous outcomes, including greater variation below mean \nheight, asymmetry around the mean, and for non routine interpersonal skills, variation over the \ntop 10 percent of heights. \nOne might argue that taller people have an advantage in interpersonal skills so the profile \nin figure 3 are to be expected.  However, the profile for Non Routine Analytic skill for males, the \nother task in ascendancy over the period, is similar to that for Non Routine Interpersonal, but it \nspans a larger interval (for males over 30 percent of a standard deviation) at shorter heights.17 \n                                                \n16 Excluding blacks and Hispanics from the sample produce does not substantially change the inference (estimates \nnot shown). \n17 The height profile for routine manual skills is flatter for both sexes. \n \n \n \n \n15 \nFinally, we examine two other socio-economic markers available in the NHIS.  The first \nis a measure of household poverty, reported in figure 4.18  For males the profile is strongly non \nlinear as there is little variation in the poverty rate above mean height and substantial variation \nbelow.  The poverty rate at average height is 5 percent.  For this outcome the height profile for \nfemales displays greater similarity to the profile for males, as the variation in the upper 10 \npercent of heights is not as prominent.  The poverty rate at average height for females is 8 \npercent. \nBecause stature is sometimes interpreted as a proxy of physical nutrition and \ndevelopment, as a second marker we also examine a measure of overall health from the NHIS.  \nIn figure 5 are the graphs for a 0/1 indicator that the respondent reports either excellent or very \ngood health.   The height profile for males displays what are now expected features.  Taller \nindividuals report little advantage relative to those at average height, while shorter males are \nsignificantly less likely to report the indicator of better health.  As was true for poverty, the \nheight profile for females shows greater resemblance to the male profile for this outcome.  The \nliterature on self reported health teaches that these profiles may be related to those in the \nprevious figures.  Justification bias raises the possibility that causality runs from poorer labour \nmarket outcomes through to poorer reported health outcomes.   In figure A2 of appendix A we \nreport the corresponding profiles for self reported health from the 2010-13 NHIS.   \nThe preceding evidence documents substantial non linearity in formal human capital \ninvestment and socio-economic outcomes at mean height. This implies that the variation in these \n                                                \n18 The measure of poverty is based family size, number of children under 18 years of age and family income using \npoverty levels derived from the Current Population Survey from the same year.  Producing poverty rates from the \nNHIS comparable to those from other sources is not straightforward (Czajka and Denmead 2008).  Here we simply \ncode persons as in poverty as per the survey supplied indicator that the individual\u2019s household income is below the \npoverty line \n \n \n \n \n16 \noutcomes by height are only experienced on average within specific segments of the height \ndistribution.  We have argued that the variation in some of these outcomes, for example, \ncompleted education, is substantial for those that experience it.  To further demonstrate this \npoint, we construct a comparison of the differences in selected outcomes by height to the \ndifferences by race/ethnicity.   \nTo do this we re-specify the controls for height in our regression equation to be dummy \nvariables for (approximately) the bottom decile, the 10th through the 30th percentiles, and the 30th \nthrough 50th percentiles of the height distribution.  In table 2 we report estimates of the dummy \nvariables for the shortest two height categories as well as for dummy variables for African \nAmericans and Hispanics from the same regression.   \nFor both females and males, short stature defined as being in the bottom 12-13 percent of \nthe distribution of height is a marker of lower educational outcomes that is persistent over time \nand economically significant in its magnitude.  For both males and females in this group the \noutcomes are very comparable to those for African Americans, with the exceptions that black \nfemales have lower rates of college completion in 2010-13 and black males have lower rates of \nhigh school drop out in both periods.  Height in the next roughly 20 percentiles is again a \npersistent indicator of lower educational attainment, but the estimates are roughly half of those \nfor the bottom decile.  The estimates for the employment rate of the bottom decile for males sit \namidst the estimates for African Americans and Hispanics, while for the shortest females the \ninference is more period specific. For excellent or very good health, among males the estimate \nfor the shortest 12 percent of height is similar to those for African Americans and Hispanics, \nwhile for females it is negative but about half as large.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n5. Can the Non Linear Profile Help Distinguish the Antecedents of the Correlation \nBetween Height and Socio-economic Outcomes? \n \n \nWe next demonstrate how this inference of a non linear height profile can provide \nleverage to distinguish among competing accounts of why height matters.  We revisit research  \nthat examines how direct measures of cognitive and non cognitive skills account for the \ncorrelation between height and wages (e.g., Lundborg et al. 2014 and Schick and Steckel 2015).    \nTo do this we start with data from the NLSY79.  The NLSY79 offers information on log hourly \nwages, but also on some of the outcomes in the NHIS such as completed education.19   Given \nsmaller sample sizes in the NLSY79 we make greater use of the more parametric regression \nmodel (2), with linear height and an interaction between height and dummy variable for height \nbelow the average.20  \nTo calibrate this analysis to the results from the NHIS, in table 3 we present estimates of \n(2) for various measures of education and for log hourly wages.   For both males and females, the \nresults for no high school diploma indicate a sharply steeper height profile below mean height \nbut little slope in the main linear profile.  For college there is again a steeper profile below mean \nheight but the estimates of the interaction effect are not statistically significant.   As summary, \nthe estimates for years of educational attainment again display a greater return below mean \nheight for both males and females.21  Finally, log wages for males display greater variation with \n                                                \n19 To maximize sample size, we focus on education reports in 1990, when the respondents would have been 25-32 \nyears old; the results are similar if we use the responses from 2014. \n20 Here the base controls are age (single year), region, and race (black and Hispanic indicators.)  \n21 We have graphed the single inch height profiles in completed education in the NLSY79.  The results echo the \npatterns observed in the NHIS.  The profile for males is clearly non linear at the mean, although the differences at \nshorter heights are smaller and the decline more gradually than in the NHIS.  Each inch of height below the mean \nadds about 0.2 years of education, but there is little association between education and height above the mean.  For \nfemales the non linearity is more modest, but again the decline at shorter heights is smaller than in the NHIS. \nMoving from being very short to average height is associated with about a 0.7 year increase in educational \nattainment, which is very similar to the change when moving from average height to being very tall. \n \n \n \n \n18 \nheight below the mean but females\u2019 wages do not.  For females the main effect of height is \nthrough the linear term, and the statistically insignificant estimate of the interaction term \nindicates a less steep slope below the mean.  Finally, most of the estimates for the SH dummy are \nsmall and all are statistically insignificant.  The results in the second panel of table 3 show that \nthese inferences are robust to restricting the sample to non Hispanic whites. \n \nThe primary measure of cognitive skill in the NLSY79 is the AFQT. As measures of non \ncognitive skills we follow research that has used the NLSY79 (i.e., Persico et al. 2004). These \nare variables capturing participation in social activities during high school and the Rosenberg \nindex of self-esteem.22  To preview our inference, in figures 6 and 7 we plot estimates of the \nsingle inch height profiles from (1) for AFQT and high school social participation, respectively.  \nThe male height profile for AFQT percentiles (figure 6) strongly echoes the height profiles for \nthe other outcomes.  It is sharply non linear and asymmetric around the mean.  Individuals in the \nbottom decile of heights score almost 30 percentiles lower than men of mean height. For women \nthe height profile of AFQT scores displays less distinct variation below the mean and in the \nupper 10 percent of heights than was evident for the other outcomes.   \n \nIn figure 7 are the height profiles for high school social activities.  The profile for males \nis different than the profiles for the other outcomes.  No sharp break at mean height, and no \nmonotonic decline in activity in the lower percentiles.  In contrast for females there is \nsystematically lower activity at the shorter heights. 23   \n                                                \n22 Social participation, \u201cactivities\u201d, is measured as the number of organizations or other extra-curricular activities the \nrespondent participated in in high school. Self-esteem is measured using the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, which is a \nmeasure that runs from 0 to 40 with higher values indicating higher self-esteem. Self-esteem was measured in 1987, \nwhen the respondents were 22-29 years old.  \n23 We have also examined an array of other measures of non cognitive skills that were collected at older ages (in \n2014). These include: two personality traits related to emotional stability (calm/emotionally stable and \nanxious/easily upset), two traits related to responsibility (dependable/self-disciplined and disorganized/careless), and \nfour traits related to social skills (extraverted/enthusiastic, sympathetic/warm, reserved/quiet, and \n \n \n \n \n19 \nWe report the corresponding estimates of (2) for each of our measures of cognitive and \nnon cognitive skills in table 4 to summarize this inference.  For males it is the estimates for the \nRosenberg measure of self esteem and AFQT that indicate a steeper slope below mean height.  \nFor high school social activities, the main correlation with height is through the linear term.  For \nfemales the estimate for the linear term is statistically significant for each measure.  While there \nis also some evidence of a steeper slope below mean height, it is only consistently statistically \nsignificant across samples for the high school social activities.   \n \nWe next evaluate whether these measures of cognitive and no cognitive skills can \naccount for the correlation between wages and height.  In the first panel of table 5 we regress \nmales\u2019 log wages on various specifications of the height profile, alternatively adding controls for \ncognitive (AFQT) skills, non-cognitive (social participation and self esteem) skills and their \ncombination.  In the first row we specify a linear height profile which is the specification \ncommon in the literature.  The estimates reveal that the estimated slope of wages in height is \nroughly one-third smaller controlling for either cognitive or non cognitive skills; marginally \nsmaller yet again when controlling for their combination. This inference is largely in line with \nthe inference in the literature (e.g., Lundborg et al. 2014, Schick and Steckel 2015).   \n \nIn the next two rows, we report the estimates when we instead specify the height profile \naccording to (2), which accommodates the greater slope of wages in height below mean height.  \nIn sharp contrast, here it is only cognitive skills that meaningfully attenuate the wage height \nprofile and the effect is exclusively in the interaction term.  The variables capturing non \ncognitive skills have a much smaller impact on the slope below mean height and perhaps a small \n                                                \ncritical/quarrelsome.).  Each is measured using participants\u2019 self-assessed ratings of pairs of personality traits on a \nscale of 1 to 7.  The majority of the height profile estimates from (2) for these traits are economically and \nstatistically insignificant.     \n \n \n \n \n20 \neffect on the linear height term.   The estimates in the next panel demonstrates that this inference \nis robust to limiting the sample to non-Hispanic white males.   \nThe corresponding results for females are in the bottom panel of table 5.  Here cognitive \nskills play the marginally larger role when the height profile is linear.   Specifying a non linear \nprofile does not significantly change this inference as the interaction terms are all statistically \ninsignificant and of reasonably similar magnitude across the columns.  Recall that the height \nprofile in female wages does not exhibit a significant break at mean height (table 3). \n \nFor males it is clear that AFQT plays a more dominant role in accounting for wages, and \nit exhibits the same non linear profile in height (figure 6) as other outcomes.  The power of \nAFQT to account for differences in adult human capital outcomes has precedence in other \nliteratures and its interpretation is not straightforward (e.g., Neal and Johnson 1996, Lang and \nManove 2011). Nominally a measure of skills, there has been much debate whether the skills \ncaptured are innate or acquired, and if the latter how they are affected by environment.   \nIn appendix C we investigate the impact of environmental factors on the relationship \nbetween height and AFQT to help sharpen its interpretation.24   There we show that neither \ncontrolling for family income or measures or school quality significantly changes the non linear \nrelationship between this measure of skills and height for males.   \nPerhaps the more telling criticism, however, is that many of the NLSY79 respondents \ncompeted the AFQT close to, or after, completing their education, and so the test could be \nviewed more as an alternative measure of completed education than of prior cognitive skills.25  In \n                                                \n24 Because each of these investigations involves restricting the sample, we present estimates including observations \nfor African Americans and Hispanics to maintain sample sizes.  The estimates (available on request) excluding these \nobservations are qualitatively similar but less precise. \n25 See, for example, Lang and Manove, (2011) for a discussion of this issue. \n \n \n \n \n21 \nthis case the results in tables AFQT are simply revealing the \u201ccompleted education\u201d is related to \nwages.  To address this point, we next use data from the NCDS which offers cognitive and non \ncognitive scores from much earlier ages.   As noted above, data from this British data set has \nfigured prominently in past research on the relationship between height and wages.   \nEstimates of the relationship between log wages and measures of cognitive and non \ncognitive skills from the NCDS, corresponding to the NLY79 results, are reported in table 6.  \nThe wage measure is from age 33,26 while we use standardized math and reading scores from age \n7 to measure cognitive skills,27 and a standardized teacher reported index of behavior, the Bristol \nSocial Adjustment Guide,28 also for this age as a measure of non cognitive skills.    \nThe results for males, in the first two rows of the top panel, support the inference from \nthe NLSY79, with the exception that the measure of non cognitive skills has less leverage.  To \ninvestigate whether the measure of non cognitive skills is from too young an age, in the next row \nwe substitute age 16, teacher reported variables capturing the child\u2019s impulsiveness, temper, \naggression, rigidity, withdrawal and industriousness, on a five point scale.  This substitution \nmakes little difference to the inference.29  We note that these NCDS measures of behaviour are \nnot irrelevant to the test score outcomes, as the estimates for these variables are precisely \n                                                \n26 We restrict the sample to \u201cEuro-Caucasians\u201d who are paid employees, and also, following the literature (Persico et \nal 2003, Schick and Steckel 2015), to full time workers.  For males this latter restriction makes little difference as \nfew within this ethnic group work part time.   For females the qualitative story remains the same but the main linear \nterm is larger in the specification following (2).   \n27 The tests are the Southgate Reading Test and the Problem Arithmetic Test.  See \nhttp://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/5805/mrdoc/pdf/CognitiveAssessmentVariables.pdf accessed September 10, \n2019. \n28 This Guide canvases children\u2019s behaviors, including withdrawal, depression, anxiety, hostility towards adults, \nrestlessness, and nervousness.  We use the survey provided total score for all \u201csyndromes\u201d.   \n29 Each variable is specified as dummy variables capturing the five categories.  We have also built up a standardized \ntotal behaviour score from teacher reports, at age 16, of 24 dimensions of the child\u2019s behavior on a 3 point scale, \nobtaining similar results.  We note that Schick and Steckel (2015) who also use the NCDS find that non cognitive \nskills play a larger role.  They use a variety of social indicators available in the survey; teacher, parent and self \nreported. They also use measures from ages 11, 16, 23 and 33, leading to a much smaller sample size than the ones \nhere.   \n \n \n \n \n22 \nestimated and comparable in magnitude to the estimates for the math scores.  The evidence here, \nhowever, is that the variation in test scores with height within the implied behavioural cells is \ncomparable to the unconditional variation. \nThe results for females are in the second panel.  Here the results again echo the NLSY79 \nin that cognitive skills substantively attenuate the slope in the linear specification, although again \nthe measures of non cognitive skills do not get much traction.  In the non linear height \nspecification, the main message is that, like in the NLSY79, this non linearity is not a significant \ncomponent of the variation of females wages with height\u2014estimates for both the SH dummy \nvariable and its interaction with height are small and statistically insignificant. \nThese results from the NCDS indicate that the age 7 measures of cognitive skills have a \nsimilar impact on the relationship between wages and height in the NCDS as AFQT has in the \nNLSY79 results.  The adult height profiles of these math and reading scores from (1) are \nreported in figure 8.   For males we observe the familiar non linearity at mean height (69\u201d), \nespecially in reading scores.  For females the non linearity at mean height is attenuated relative \nto the evidence in previous figures, while there is also evidence of higher scores at the tallest \nheights.  The estimates of (2) for each of these outcomes reported in table 7 confirms this \ninference.   \n6. What are Antecedents of the Non Linear Adult Height profile in Childhood \nCognitive Scores? \n \nThe results so far indicate that a non linear relationship between cognitive scores and \nadult height is evident in both the teenage years and in later childhood (age 7).  This suggests \nthat the underlying causes may lie in earlier childhood and/or birth outcomes.   The NCDS \nprovides direct observations on birth outcomes such as birth weight and prematurity from \n \n \n \n \n23 \nmedical records.  It also provides some information on parent characteristics such as education \nand social class. \nWe first take up the possibility that significant birth outcomes vary by adult height.  \nThere is now a large literature on the effects of birth outcomes such as low birth weight on adult \noutcomes.  One reason to suspect these outcomes might vary with adult height is that recent \nresearch has identified a genetic link between fetal growth and postnatal growth (Horikoshi et al. \n2013). Also, there is some evidence that outcomes such as low birth weight vary with mother\u2019s \nheight.  In a meta study Han et al. (2012) report that in unadjusted data, shorter women have a \nhigher risk of both premature and low birth weight births, while taller women have a decreased \nrisk, although these relationships do not always hold controlling for possible confounders.30  The \nhypothesized reasons shorter stature should be associated with these outcomes include (Zhang et \nal. 2015) that it a) imposes a physical constraint on the intrauterine environment, b) is a marker \nof the mother\u2019s lifetime social and nutritional condition and c) represents a genetic association \nbetween polymorphisms that influence both maternal height and pregnancy fetal outcomes.  The \nstrong heredity of height would provide a pathway from mother\u2019s stature and poor birth \noutcomes to children\u2019s realized height. \nWe provide direct evidence on the variation of selected birth outcomes by mother\u2019s \nheight taking advantage of the addition of mother\u2019s height to US birth certificates in the 2003 \nrevision.  We focus on three birth outcomes that have been related to later life outcomes such as \neducational attainment (e.g., Oreopoulos et al. 2008): birth weight, five minute APGAR and \ngestational age.   We draw samples of singleton births for non Hispanic whites from the 2011 \n                                                \n30 Notably many of the studies they survey are of births at selected hospitals or within specific ethnic groups rather \nthan the nationally representative data we use in the following analysis. \n \n \n \n \n24 \npublic use sample to abstract from the higher rates of certain birth outcomes among multiple \nbirths and in certain ethnic/racial populations.   \n In table 8 are estimates of the mothers\u2019 height profile from (2) for measures of low birth \nweight, very low birth weight, low five minute APGAR and premature birth, not conditioning on \nany other characteristics of births or mothers.   For each outcome and both sexes, greater height \nis associated with better outcomes and the return to height is significantly greater at heights \nbelow the mean.   \nEstimates of the height profile from (1) for low birth weight, presented in Figure 9, \nindicate that the summary estimates in table 9 are not misrepresenting the data.  The mean rate of \nlow birth weight births at mean height (64\u201d) is 5.7 percent for female births and 4.8 percent for \nmale births.  Therefore, at the 25th percentile of height (62\u201d) the rates of low birth weight are \n25% (males) to 31% (females) higher than at mean height.31 \nWhile height is largely heritable\u2014up to 80 percent of height is estimated to be \nattributable to inherited DNA sequences32\u2014the higher rates of poor birth outcomes of mothers of \nlower heights might not imply higher rates for below average height offspring, if the hereditary \n                                                \n31 A secondary question here is whether the height profile in, for example, low birth weight, reflects a \u201cpure\u201d effect \nof height or whether it is partly a result of correlated factors.  Low birth weight and prematurity are related as the \nlatter is cited to be a cause of the former.   To investigate this possibility we have estimated the height profile for \nlow birth weight from (2) conditioning on the child\u2019s parity and gestational age at birth (gestational age is coded into \n10 categories ranging from under 20 weeks to 42 weeks or older entered as dummy variables), the mother\u2019s age and \neducation, and dummy variables indicating the mother smoked during pregnancy, was in receipt of Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) benefits (see Currie and Rajani (2015) and \nSonchak (2016) on this factor) started prenatal care in the first trimester and was underweight as indicated by her pre \npregnancy BMI (underweight is defined as BMI<18.5;  while mother\u2019s weight is related to the incidence of low \nbirth weight, past research identifies the slight stature as the primary risk factor). The unconditional estimates for the \nslightly smaller sample with non missing values of these control covariates (not reported) match well the estimates \nin table 8.  The additional controls attenuate but do not eliminate the height profile in low birth weight, and the \nreturns to height remain asymmetrical around the mean. \n32 See, for example, https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/traits/height (accessed July 24, 2018).  \n \n \n \n \n25 \nlink is \u201cundone\u201d by how adults partner on height.  That is, if shorter women tend to \nsystematically mate with taller men, they wouldn\u2019t systematically have shorter offspring.  \nTo provide evidence on the consequences of partnering by height for the heights of any \noffspring, we use data from the 1995/96 NHIS.33 We match opposite sex married partners and \ncompare their adult heights.  We find a find that shorter (below mean height) individuals are \nmore likely to match with each other, they are relatively less likely to match with average height \nindividuals than above average height individuals, and they are relatively less likely to match \nwith taller individuals.34   \nWe next simulate the heights of any children of these couples using Tanner\u2019s (target \nheight) TH formula:35 the predicted adult height of offspring is midparent (the average of \nparents\u2019) height plus 2.5 inches for males and minus 2.5 inches for females.36  For each female \nheight we then calculate the proportion of male partners of females of this height in the data who \nwould produce a male or female offspring of below average height by this formula.  These \ncalculations indicate that 84% of the male offspring, and 63% of the female offspring, of women \nof stature 63\u201d or less will attain below average adult height.  Alternatively, 60 % of the below \n                                                \n33 We use these two years of data because matching partners within households is relatively straightforward in these \nyears and they are in a period with relatively high response rates.  We match opposite sex married adults by family \ntype and household ID. With the 1997 redesign of the NHIS adult height is collected for only one sample adult in \neach surveyed family. \n34 We calculate the local log odds ratio of opposite sex married matches across various groupings of heights.  If we \ndefine two height groups, S and T, then the local log odds is ln\n(788\u22177::)\n(78:\u22177:8),  where \ud835\udc5b=> is the number of matches in the \ndata between S height males and T height females.  Roughly speaking, this measure is the ratio of the frequency of \nwithin group matches to across group matches.  If matching was random the value of this log odds would be zero.  \nMore positive values indicate a preference for within group matches over across group matches.  We divide males \nand females into three groups S, M and T, where M is 70\u201d for males and 64\u201d for females.  The local log odds of SM \nmatches is 0.39, of MT matches is 0.22 and of ST matches is 0.88.  \n35 See, for example, van Dommelen et al. (2012). \n36 While this method of prediction has its limitations relative to methods that use more detailed measurements of the \nchild at young ages, it has the advantage of feasibility given the (pre birth) data at hand.  The mean predicted adult \nheight of male offspring using this method is 70\u201d and of female offspring  is 64\u201d.  However, the distribution of \nheights is more compressed then we observe in our NHIS samples. We round all fractional predictions downwards \n(e.g., 66.5\u201d is coded as 66\u201d) to match the whole number recording of heights in our surveys. \n \n \n \n \n26 \naverage height male offspring and 72% of the below average height female offspring predicted in \nthis way have mothers who are of below average height.  Therefore, there is reason to expect that \nthe higher rates of poor birth outcomes for shorter females are disproportionately associated with \noffspring of below average adult height. \nDirect evidence on the relationship between low birth weight and adult height is available \nfrom the NCDS.  Estimates of the height profile following (1) for males and females are \npresented in figure 10.  For males we observe some non linearity below mean height, although it \nis confined to the lower 25 percent of the height distribution, and the confidence intervals are \nlarge.  The rate of low birth weight at average height is 4%, so the differences at the shorter \nheights are substantive.  For females the variation in the rate below mean height is a little larger \nthan above mean height.  The low birth weight rate at mean height here is 4.7%. \nThere is also a large literature on how family background variables mediate children\u2019s \noutcomes.  For example, controlling for parental education might capture the financial resources \na child has access to in childhood and/or the support and encouragement s/he receives to pursue \neducation.  The NCDS does not provide direct informational on parents\u2019 educational attainments, \nbut information on the age at which each left full time education by single year ranging from \naged 13 or less through age 23 or more.  There is also information on the mother\u2019s husband\u2019s and \nher father\u2019s \u201csocial class\u201d.37   \n                                                \n37 Making use of these variables, however, changes the sample in potentially significant ways.  For example, the \ninformation on parents\u2019 education was collected in the age 16 wave, and in the (smaller) male sample which has \nvalid observations on both the age the mother and father left full time education and age 33 wages, there is little \nevidence of a non linear relationship between height and wages.  The sample is almost 700 observations smaller than \nthe one used in the first two rows of table 7, and the estimates of the linear height term and the height interaction \nterm are 0.013 (0.007) and 0.013 (0.020), respectively (standard errors in parentheses).  This problem is attenuated \nsomewhat in the following analysis as while respondents must have valid observations on age 33 height to be \nincluded in the analysis sample, we do not condition on valid observations of age 33 wages.  \n \n \n \n \n27 \nEither birth outcomes such as birthweight, or parental background variables, could \nalternatively capture some inherited endowment from parents to offspring, or latent background \nvariables. Black et al. (2007), however, argue that, at least for longer term outcomes, within twin \nestimates of the impact of low birth weight compare favourably to estimates from across \nfamilies, suggesting birthweight has an effect independent of these confounders.   \n  In table 9 we present estimates of (2) using the age 7 cognitive scores as the dependent \nvariable and alternatively controlling for birthweight, parental education or both.  We enter \nbirthweight as a quadratic to allow a more nuanced effect than a dummy variable for low birth \nweight.38  We specify parents\u2019 school leaving age as single age dummy variables.     \nIn the first panel are the results for males.  If we specify a linear height profile, then the \nvariation of reading scores with height is lower by roughly a fifth controlling for either parental \neducation or birthweight, and by almost 50 percent controlling for both.  This would suggest that \nthese factors can account for a non trivial part of the cognitive score/height gradient. \nFurthermore, because the impacts are additive in combination, any omitted factors they proxy for \ndo not appear to be common. \nSpecifying the height profile more appropriately as non linear (row 2) tempers this \ninference.  The substantive and additive impact of these two factors remains for the main linear \neffect, but the linear term represents the minority of the variation of reading scores with height.  \nTheir impact on the variation of scores below mean height is again roughly additive but more \nmodest.  At best the variation of scores with height in this part of the distribution within the \n                                                \n38 Specifying a cubic in birthweight leads to very similar inference.  The estimates using a dummy variable for low \nbirth weight indicate a marginally smaller contribution of birthweight.  The specification of birthweight as a \npolynomial is consistent with evidence in Oreopoulos et al. 2008 that the effects of lower birth weight are not \ndiscrete. \n \n \n \n \n28 \nimplied birthweight and parental education cells is 10 percent smaller than it is across the \nsample.   \nThe results for the age 7 math scores in the next two rows tell a very similar story.  When \nthe height profile is specified non linearly, the leverage of birthweight and parental education for \nthe main linear profile is again additive and comprehensive, but their leverage for the interaction \nterm is limited. \nThe results for females are in the second panel.  The results for the reading scores follow \nthe inference for the male results, although for females the variation of scores with height \nthrough the main linear effect is relatively larger.   For the math scores there is little evidence for \na non linear height profile, and the inference from the two specifications is very similar \nWe have examined alternative specifications of the birth outcome and background \nvariables.  For males, controls for premature birth, fetal distress and pregnancy abnormality, as \nwell as for the timing and number of prenatal doctor visits has little effect on the estimates of the \ninteraction effect, as do controls for fathers\u2019 class.  For females, the controls for father\u2019s class \nhave more leverage but not as much as the controls for parents\u2019 education. \nGiven the evidence in other research of the impact of low birth weight on socio-economic \noutcomes, one might conclude that table 9 indicates that it plays some role in the variation of test \nscores with height.  Interpretation of the results controlling for parental education is less clear, \nhowever, due to the aforementioned possibility that it captures relevant genetic inheritance from \nparents.  Furthermore, as the relationship between completed education and height documented \nin figure 1 appears persistent over time, parental education may not only proxy for factors such \nas family income and parental encouragement to pursue education, but also for parental height \nand whatever genetic and other environmental factors that work through that channel. \n \n \n \n \n29 \nTo attempt to provide greater clarity on this point, we next add measures of mother\u2019s and \nfather\u2019s heights as additional control variables.  This further restricts the analysis sample to \nchildren who have valid observations for both these measures.39  An implication is that any \nevidence of a non linear height profile in females\u2019 reading scores is not present in this sample so \nwe only present the linear height specification for this group.40  Also, the estimates for the \ninteraction terms for males are attenuated in this sample.   \nWe specify both mother\u2019s and father\u2019s height as quadratics,41 and consider all pairwise \nadditions of the controls so their relative contributions are transparent.  The results are presented \nin table 10.  For males the variation of scores with height is smaller within parental height cells \nthan within parental education cells, and the marginal contribution of parental education \nconditional on parental height is very small.   In contrast the marginal contribution of parental \nheight conditional on parental education is non trivial.  This suggests that whatever information \nis captured by parental education is spanned by parental height but not vice versa.  Also, once \nagain birth weight appears to make a different account of the variation in scores with height as its \nimpact is additive to the account of parents\u2019 height.  The estimates for females tell a similar \nstory, although there is greater variation residual variation in reading scores conditioning on \nthese three factors. \n                                                \n39 This is also true in the analysis in table 9 using parents\u2019 education (see footnote 37), although the numbers of \nobservations with valid observations for mother\u2019s education but not for father\u2019s education is relatively small \n(roughly 100 observations).  The number of observations with valid observations of mother\u2019s height (collected in \nsweep 0) but not for father\u2019s height (collected in sweep 2) is larger (roughly 550 observations).  In both cases \nchildren with missing observations for their father are marginally shorter than those with valid observations. \n40 The estimate of the interaction term is consistently very small and statistically insignificant. Also the estimates of \nthe main linear term and the impacts of the controls are almost identical in the two specifications.    \n41 Specifying linear or cubic profiles in mother\u2019s and father\u2019s height makes little difference to the results for the \nlinear height profile.  For the non linear height profile, a cubic specification of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s height makes \nlittle difference to the results, but a linear specification reduces the contribution of parents\u2019 height to males reading \nscores. \n \n \n \n \n30 \nA final message of these results is that while conditional on a linear specification of the \nheight profile the variation of scores with height within parental height/ birthweight cells is \nsmaller by roughly two-thirds, in samples where the non linear specification of the height profile \nis supported the variation in scores with height below the average is more \u201crobust\u201d to these \ncontrols. \n7. Discussion and Conclusions \nWe provide new evidence on how important socioeconomic outcomes vary with height.  \nFor both males and females, we find significant non linearities in the height profile.  The height \nprofile for males exhibits non linearity and asymmetry at average height.  The implication is that \nalmost all the variation in these outcomes with height is below average height, so there is no \nadvantage to being tall per se.  For females we find smaller non linearity and asymmetry at mean \nheight, but also variation with height in the upper tenth of the height distribution, which in the \noutcomes we investigate confers an advantage to the tallest.  An implication of this finding is \nthat previous evidence of variation in outcomes in height, typically estimated by a linear height \nprofile, are experienced more acutely by only segments of the distribution of heights. \nWe bring this finding to the question in the literature whether cognitive or non cognitive \nskills lie behind the relationship between wages and height.  Recent evidence suggests both play \na role.  For males, once we allow non linearity in the wage/height profile, we find it is cognitive \nskills that play the dominant role.   Our measures of these skills, taken from both the later \nchildhood (age 7) and teenage years display the same non linearity in adult height as outcomes \nsuch as completed education and occupational skills. \nWe also search for antecedents of the non linear adult height profile in childhood \ncognitive skills. We present evidence that suggests poorer birth outcomes may play a role.  We \n \n \n \n \n31 \nfind that birthweight provides some account of the variation of test scores with height for \nfemales, but has limited relevance to the variation of male scores below average height.  More \nsalient for both males and females is parental height, a factor that also appears to span any role of \nparental education in the test score/height relationship. \nHeight is strongly heritable. Therefore, it is of interest that the variation in outcomes by \nheight is attenuated controlling for parents\u2019 height. This implies that any advantage to being \ntaller only partially transcends the legacy of having shorter parents.  However, what that legacy \nis remains elusive. The systematic and persistent association of social economic outcomes with \nbelow average height, which we document in the first part of this paper, will imply \ncorresponding differences in childhood environmental factors that persist over generations. Also, \ngenetic inheritance specific to parts of the height distribution will tend to persist, aided by \nassortative mating on height.  Unpacking the legacy of parental height remains an important \ntopic for future research. \nThese findings have potentially important implications for research on programs to \naddress economic inequality and on the role of background factors in socioeconomic outcomes.  \nThere is little evidence whether height is a significant mediator of social program impacts.  Such \nevidence could inform program design and evaluation, and underline the need to assimilate \nevidence from other disciplines of how labour market skills and attributes vary with adult \nheight.42  Also, the systematic association of lower socioeconomic outcomes with adult height \n                                                \n42 For example, in addition to the correlations with cognitive and non cognitive skills which have been the focus of \neconomic research, there are documented relationships between height and hearing (Berranas et al. 2015, Welch and \nDawes 2007 ), spatial skills (Zhou et al. 2016), sense of feeling (Peters et al. 2009 and (as evidenced by occupational \nchoice) competition and freedom to make decisions (Baker and Cornelson 2018).  \n \n \n \n \n32 \nbelow the average, particularly for males, further complicates the interpretation of research on \nthe relationship between family background factors and children\u2019s outcomes. \nFinally, our findings provide an additional piece of the puzzle of whether variation in \nproductive attributes, labor market discrimination or social experiences in adolescence lie behind \nthe variation of socio-economic outcomes with height.  The evidence presented here casts some \ndoubt on teenage social experience as the primary explanation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n33 \nReferences \n \nAutor, D.H., Levy, F. and R.J.

We draw \ndata from the \u201cDemographic\u201d, \u201cBody Measures\u201d and \u201cWeight History\u201d files in each wave, and \nagain select the sample of respondents between the ages of 25 and 59.    NHANES is a much \nsmaller survey of health outcomes, which includes both examination and survey components.  \nBecause height is captured in both components, the NHANES offers evidence of the error in self \nreported height, and has been used for this purpose in the past (e.g., Sahyoun et al. 2008, Merrill \nand Richardson 2009).  That said, the NHANES has a complex sampling design and therefore \ndepends significantly on weights to generate population levels estimates43, and has a lower \nresponse rate than other health surveys (Czajka and Beyler 2016).  Also, differences in the \nsurvey response reports of medical conditions in the NHANES have been shown to differ from \nthose in other health surveys (Czajka and Beyler 2016). \nOur primary concern is that the non linear height profiles we have uncovered are a result \nof errors in self reported height.  In figure B1 we report height profiles, for males and females, of \nthe proportion of respondents reporting less than a high school education, using alternatively \nexamination recorded and self reported heights.   As a point of comparison in figure B2 we \nreport the corresponding profiles form the 1990-94 NHIS.  Note that the comparison of the NHIS \nand NHANES figures is complicated by the wide span of survey cohorts we need to include from \nthe NHANES data to generate sufficient sample sizes.   \n                                                \n43 For example, Hispanics and African American make up roughly one quarter each of the unweighted sample aged \n25-59. \n \n \n \n \n59 \nThe NHANES source figure for males displays a similar non linear profile as in the NHIS \ndata, regardless of the measure of height used.  In terms of levels, the profile using self reported \nheight lies above the exam recorded height profile, more often than not, especially at some of the \nshorter heights and the heights just above mean height.   \nFor females the profile using either measure of height is more linear than for males, as it \nis the NHIS.   If anything the profile using examination height displays more non linearity at \nshorter heights, but more generally both profiles tell a similar story \n \n \n \n \n \n \n60 \nFigure B1: Males and Females Proportion with No High School by Height, NHANES \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nNotes: Authors calculations from the 1999/00 through 2013/14 NHANES.

To help ensure that family income is capturing \nchildhood inputs, we restrict the sample to respondents who were living in their parents\u2019 homes \nin 1979. The baseline estimates for this sample, with no control for parental income, are \npresented in columns (1) and (3) of table C1. The non-linear relationship between height and \nAFQT for males holds in this sample although the standard errors are larger due to the reduction \nin sample size. For females there is a switch in sign in the interaction effect indicating a flatter \nrelationship between AFQT and height below the mean.  In columns (2) and (4) are the estimates \ncontrolling for parental income. The estimates change very little for either sex. This evidence \nsuggests that parental income plays a limited role in the relationship between height and AFQT \nscores in this sample. \nNext we test whether school quality mediates the height/AFQT profile.  In table C2 we \npresent a corresponding set of regression estimates, this time conditioning on measures of the \nfraction of students who are disadvantaged; the fraction of students in different racial groups; \ndropout and attendance rates; enrollment; the number of teachers and counsellors; the number of \nbooks in the library; the fraction of teachers with graduate degrees; the fraction of teachers who \nleft the school in the previous year; and starting teacher salaries.44 Columns (1) and (3) show the \nbaseline results for the sample with non-missing values for the school quality variables, while \ncolumns (2) and (4) show the results with the addition of controls. For males, adding school \n                                                \n44 The school quality measures are from the \"background\" section of the NLSY79 school transcript survey. \n \n \n \n \n63 \nquality controls leads to a modest decline in the estimate of the interaction effect.  For females, \nthe estimate of the main linear effect of height well matches the estimate from the main sample \nand is unaffected by the additional controls.  The estimate of the interaction effect, however, is \nsmaller and switches sign adding the controls for school quality.   \nTable C1: The relationship between Adult Height and AFQT with and without controls for \nparents\u2019 income, NLSY79 \n \n \nMales \nFemales \nHeight \n-0.337 \n(0.727) \n-0.585 \n(0.742) \n1.409** \n(0.631) \n1.310** \n(0.630) \nHeight x SH \n2.075* \n(1.073) \n2.136** \n(1.048) \n-1.107 \n(1.048) \n-1.200 \n(1.048) \nSH \n-5.010 \n(3.635) \n-4.659 \n(3.517) \n-2.178 \n(3.075) \n-2.791 \n(3.176) \nParents\u2019 income \n \n0.001*** \n(0.000) \n \n0.000** \n(0.000) \nN \n1,139 \n1,139 \n1,085 \n1,085 \n \nNotes: Authors calculations from the NLSY79.
